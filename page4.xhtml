            When we think of museums, we think of vast corridors of art and artefacts lined neatly to be examined and
            contemplated by visitors.
            But it is not like this.
            These days dynamic elements of exploring history and objects of art are finding their way into museum
            cultures.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Bihar Museum, situated in Patna, is one of the largest museums in India and one of the most ambitious
            projects undertaken by a state government in India.
            The museum galleries chronologically illustrate the history of Bihar and its impact on the subcontinent.
            With its remarkable infrastructure, The Bihar Museum is one of the best places to visit in Patna.

            <h3>● Exhibits :-</h3>
            <br />
            The Bihar Museum has several galleries.
            These include the Orientation gallery, the children gallery, the regional gallery, the contemporary gallery,
            the historical art galleries, the Bihari Diaspora gallery and the visible storage gallery.
            The exhibits on different subjects are displayed in separate galleries.
            Each gallery is huge and has many artifacts on display including ones dating back to the fourth century.
            </p>
            <p class="infopara">
            <h3>● Orientation Room :-</h3>
            <br />
            The orientation exhibits are designed to engage children by transporting them to natural environments and
            making them curious to learn.
            A storybook-style illustrated map of India with important places and major transportation routes greets the
            children at the Orientation Room.
            A large sculpture of the sparrow and related exhibits illustrate to young children why the state bird, the
            sparrow, is endangered.
            Images are brought to life through flat screen monitors and lenticular printed graphics.
            Animated animals and historical figures pop out inviting children to discover more about them.
            Special events of the day can be seen in “What’s On Today”, projected on screens fitted within birdhouses on
            a stylized tree of Sikki grass.
            </p>
            <p class="infopara">
            <h3>● Children’s Gallery :-</h3>
            <br />
            The Children’s Gallery brings the history of Bihar and natural history alive for children.
            The gallery is specially designed to ignite the curiosity of young children.
            Education is combined with entertainment and enjoyable activities.
            There are six experiential learning zones – the Orientation Room, Wildlife Sanctuary, history sections on
            Chandragupta Maurya and Sher Shah Suri, the Arts and Culture section and the Discovery Room.
            Exhibits illustrate concepts through dramatic recreation and storytelling techniques.
            Various tools and visual aids encourage hands-on learning and explorations.
            </p>
            <p class="infopara">
            <h3>● Chandragupta Maurya: First Emperor of India :-</h3>
            <br />
            Enter a miniaturized version of Pataliputra, past the gates of the Mauryan City Wall.
            Here, you can read about Patna of earlier times as described by Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to
            Chandragupta’s court, in his account titled Indica.
            Sit on a king’s throne and imagine you are Chandragupta Maurya.
            Past the Toran Gates, answer seven questions which reveal “What does it take to be a king?” The Mauryans
            wore very elaborate headgear and the wall of mirrors has a number of mirrors with headgear sculpted into the
            frames.
            You will be able to see yourself with a fashionable Mauryan hairstyle or headgear!
            </p>
            <p class="infopara">
            <h3>● Arts and Culture Section comes alive :-</h3>
            <br />
            The primary exhibit is a curved wall with a grid of panels displaying Madhubani art.
            Some of the sections hold display monitors and films depict animated dancers painted in Madhubani style.
            Children will enjoy watching these animated paintings which are accompanied by music.
            A large Mauryan-style terracotta horse painted in Madhubani style is a centrepiece attraction.
